# Craigeslist GoScrapper
A simple Web Scrapper using colly in GoLang! This is a terminal based application that quickly sends you all the links to everything that is free on craigelist.

## Want to use it for yourself?

simply git clone this repo into your local files, 
Install both colly, and go
then at the bottom of main.go replace our default link with a craigeslist link of your own.
Once done, you can. run `$go run main.go` and the links will print to your terminal.
